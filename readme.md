# Sorting Visualizer


Sorting Visualizer using SDL2 Library

This visualizer demonstrates the working of various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. The list size is fixed at 130 elements. You can randomize the list and choose any sorting algorithm to apply from the available options. All sorting algorithms sort the elements in ascending order.

The sorting time displayed is not precisely equivalent to the algorithms' actual time complexities. To ensure proper visualization, relatively faster algorithms like Merge Sort have been delayed.

# How to run:-

To run the Sorting Visualizer using the provided C++ source code, you have two options for setting up the SDL2 library:

1. **Manual Setup**: Follow the instructions provided in [Lazy Foo' Productions' tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php) to download and set up the SDL2 library. Remember to use the x86_64-w64-mingw32 folder instead of i686-w64-mingw32 for the 64-bit SDL2 library.

2. **Video Tutorial**: If you prefer a visual guide, you can watch this helpful video tutorial: [How to download and setup SDL2 library](https://youtu.be/jUZZC9UXyFs?si=HhUmZlBwiwdSbnvH). The video provides step-by-step instructions for setting up SDL2.

Once you've set up the SDL2 library, include the main.cpp file from the repository into your project. Follow the build options mentioned in the tutorial or video tutorial. If you encounter any issues during setup, you can refer back to the documentation or the video tutorial for assistance.
 
# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
